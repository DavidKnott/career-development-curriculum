# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
*This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals
*List your longterm goal(s) of what you want to accomplish by the end of module 4*
I want to have a job offer.
I want to have started my own podcast.

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day
I will get everything I feel that I need polished done during the offweekd before module 4.
Then I will cold out reach and apply for 1 job everyday of module4.

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
*How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?*
I want to have an indepth understanding of react.
I want to do a coding excersim eveyday in Ruby, Python, and Javascript.
#### Opportunities Research:
*How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?* 
I will use my Trellow Board by continueing to use it to contact companies I'd like to work for.
#### Cold Outreach/Network:
*Who will you reach out to? Have you considered talking with alumni about their own networking practices when they started their job search?
I will reach out to recruiters first to talk to them about the recruiting process and get their advice as to what I should do (after all it is their job and if they like me they might have some good ideas).

#### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
*How might personal branding pieces help you towards your goal?*
I will start my own personal brand by creating my own podcast.
My goal is to be the first David Knott that comes up when I Google my name.
### Timeline:
*What will you do when?*
Every Sunday I will check in to see how I'm reaching my goals and figure out if I need to devote more time coding or job searching based on my past weeks performance.

#### Module Tasks:
*What will you do throughout the module?*
I will send out a cold out reach email and apply for a job everyday.

#### Weekly Tasks:
*What will you do throughout each week?*
Every week I will reflect on Sunday to see how I'm doing.

## What I Will Work on with Meg
*What advice do you need? What would be helpful to talk through? Let Meg know here!*
I will utilize Meg by asking her to review what I'm sending back and by implementing the feedback she gives me.
